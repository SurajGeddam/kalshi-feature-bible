# Comprehensive Screenshot Review - In Progress

## Review Process

For each feature section:
1. Read the feature description
2. Check which screenshots are referenced
3. Verify screenshot IDs match the feature being described
4. Check screenshot descriptions in index match the feature
5. Flag any mismatches

## Issues Found

### Missing Screenshot References (6)
- [x] 025, 026, 027 - Added to Detailed Market Page section
- [ ] 103 - Documents Page (need to add section)
- [ ] 104 - Incentives Page (need to add section)  
- [ ] 107 - Referrals Page (need to add section)

### Potential Screenshot Mismatches to Verify

Need manual verification that screenshots actually show what text describes:

1. **Detailed Market Page** - Verify 021-027, 043-046 match descriptions
2. **Orderbook Popup** - Verify 051-055 match orderbook features
3. **Buy/Sell Interface** - Verify 047-050 match buy/sell tabs
4. **Calendar Popup** - Verify 028-031 match calendar features
5. **All category pages** - Verify category screenshots match descriptions

## Next Steps

1. Add missing sections for Documents, Incentives, Referrals
2. Manually verify each screenshot reference matches content
3. Fix any mismatches found
